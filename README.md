# Thinking_in_Balance
Research Paper Implementation


ABSTRACT: This code simulates a “cognitive load balancer” system for a team of users with different cognitive styles (BDI).

It models:
	•	Tasks with intrinsic difficulty (load) and type (linked to thinking styles).
	•	Users with style-specific skill factors (they handle their preferred type of task more efficiently).
	•	Task assignment and rebalancing by a Coordinator AI that distributes tasks to prevent overload and reduce task switching.
	•	Execution and completion of tasks, with probabilistic errors influenced by load.
	•	A full simulation loop where tasks are created, assigned, monitored, possibly reassigned, and eventually completed.

The program logs all these events to show how tasks move across users, how overloads are handled, and when tasks are finished.




Enjoy playing with it!
