# Thinking_in_Balance
Research Paper Implementation

Balancing cognitive load across human-AI teams using Cognitive Load Theory and BDI (Brain Dominance Instrument) thinking styles quadrants. We draw inspiration from the Paper2Agent approach, which wraps core functionalities of research papers into modular “tools” that an AI agent can invoke.

It creates a group of users, each with a thinking style (analytical, sequential, interpersonal, creative).

It generates a set of tasks with different types and levels of complexity.

A coordinating AI assigns tasks to users, trying to match task type with the most suitable style while avoiding overload.

If a user becomes overburdened or switches task types too frequently, the AI rebalances by redistributing tasks.

Users complete some tasks in each round, with the possibility of errors if their load is too high.

The cycle repeats until all tasks are completed.

At the end, the simulation presents a summary: how many tasks were completed, how many times they were reassigned, and how they were distributed by type.

In summary: This model demonstrates how an AI could act as a “cognitive load balancer,” assigning and redistributing tasks based on cognitive style and each person’s current effort.



Enjoy playing with it!
